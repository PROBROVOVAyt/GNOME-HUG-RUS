Notifications

Notifications are used to inform users about events that are relevant to them. Examples include:

* when a download or other long-running operation has finished
* when new content is available
* when a message has been received

Because they are shown by the system, notifications are a useful way of communicating with users while they are using other apps. If a message is only relevant while the sender app is being used, :doc:`toasts <toasts>` are a better option.

General Guidelines
------------------

* Be careful not to needlessly distract users with notifications, and question whether users really need to be informed about the events you want to communicate.
* Apps that deal with lots of events, such as email or social media messages, run a particular risk of distracting users with too many notifications. In these situations:
   * It is often desirable to place restrictions on how frequently notifications are shown. For example, instead of showing a notification for each new message, periodic notifications can show a summary of messages that have been received.
   * Provide an option for users to disable and/or reduce the number of notifications.
* Ensure that your app removes notifications that are no longer valid. For example, a notification for a weather warning that has been revoked, or for emails that have been read.
* Don't rely solely on notifications for communicating something, as they might not always be seen. The app window should independently communicate all the information contained in notifications.

Notification Elements
---------------------

Notifications in GNOME have a number of standard elements:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Element
    - Description
  * - App Icon
    - Indicates which app sent the notification.
  * - Title
    - A short and concise summary of the event that triggered the notification, written in :ref:`header capitalization<header-capitalization>`. The notification should be understandable from the title alone.
  * - Body
    - An optional sentence which gives extra detail about the notification, written in :ref:`sentence capitalization<sentence-capitalization>`. 
  * - Default Action
    - The action that is triggered when the notification body is clicked. This should dismiss the notification and show the relevant part of the source app window.
  * - Actions
    -  Each notification can include up to three buttons.

Notification Actions
--------------------

It is possible to add buttons to notifications, to allow users to quickly respond to them. Guidelines for these:

* Only use notification actions when the functionality that they provide is often required.
* Notification actions should be related to the content of the notification.
* Actions should not replace user interface controls elsewhere — it should be possible to take the same actions from your app’s windows.
* Notification actions should not duplicate the default action. For example, a new email notification does not need to include an Open button, since the default action should already perform this action.
