Browsing
========

Browsing changes what is shown in a view. Users open views by clicking on content items or links, and can return to previous views using the back button.

Some apps use browsing as a key part of their navigation, such as in the case of web browsers and file managers. However, more limited forms of browsing can be used to navigate content structures within an app, such as for collections of content items, or multiple views of settings or information (see the :doc:`navigation guidelines </guidelines/navigation>`).

Guidelines
----------

* In left-to-right locales, the standard position for the back button is the top-left. This position is an important part of recognition.
* Refer to the different :doc:`general navigation guidelines </guidelines/navigation>` when desiging a navigation structure. 
* :doc:`Header bars </patterns/containers/header-bars>` should update to reflect what is being shown in the current view. This can include changing the heading, any controls, and switching between a :doc:`primary and secondary menu </patterns/controls/menus>`.
* Support the :ref:`standard keyboard shortcuts for navigation <navigation-shortcuts>`.
